## Prep: The Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is ones ability to overcome challenges throught hard work and focus.
1. Challenges
   - Have some thing you really want to improve
   - Take what comes head on
2. Obstacles
4. Effort
    - What u need to put in to reach your goal

## Data Structures and Algorithms
1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
    - Efficiency: Consider the efficiency requirements of the problem. Different data structures have different time and space complexities for various operations. Choose a data structure that provides efficient operations for the specific problem requirements. For example, if fast insertion and deletion are required, a linked list or a balanced binary search tree may be a good choice. If fast retrieval of elements based on a key is needed, a hash table may be more suitable.

    Functionality: Consider the specific functionality needed for the problem. Different data structures have different capabilities. For example, if you need to maintain elements in a sorted order, a binary search tree or a sorted array may be appropriate. If you need to track the order of insertion, a linked list or an array may be more suitable.

    Memory Constraints: Consider the memory limitations of the system. Some data structures require more memory overhead than others. If memory is a constraint, choose a data structure that uses memory efficiently. For example, an array may be more memory-efficient compared to a linked list if random access is required.

    Maintainability: Consider the ease of implementation and maintenance of the chosen data structure. Some data structures have simpler implementations than others. Choose a data structure that is easy to understand and maintain in the long run.

2. How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
    - To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you can take the following precautions:

        - Base Case: Ensure that your recursive function has a base case that will terminate the recursion. The base case is a condition that, when met, stops the function from making further recursive calls. It acts as the termination condition for the recursion.

        - Recursive Progression: Make sure that the recursive function progresses towards the base case in each recursive call. This means that the input parameters or arguments should be modified in such a way that they move closer to the base case with each recursive call. This ensures that the recursive calls eventually reach the base case and stop.

        - Correct Termination Condition: Ensure that the termination condition in the base case is correctly defined and will eventually be met. If the termination condition is not met, the recursive calls will continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

        - Tail Recursion (where applicable): Tail recursion is a technique where the recursive call is the last operation performed in the recursive function. Some programming languages and compilers optimize tail recursion to avoid stack overflow. If tail recursion is applicable to your problem, it can be used to mitigate the risk of an infinite recursive call stack.
