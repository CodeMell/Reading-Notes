# Readings: Unit Testing and Documentation

## [Unit Testing Best Practices](https://stackify.com/unit-testing-basics-best-practices/)

 ### ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity

- Catching Bugs Early: By writing unit tests, developers can identify bugs and errors in their code much earlier in the development cycle, before they propagate to other parts of the application. This can save time and money in the long run by reducing the cost of fixing bugs later in the development cycle.

- Improving Code Quality: Unit testing can help improve code quality by ensuring that each unit of code is functioning correctly and as expected. This helps to prevent errors and unexpected behavior in the application.

- Frequent Releases: By testing code in isolation, developers can quickly identify and fix issues, allowing for faster iteration and more frequent releases.

- Encouraging Good Programming Habits: Writing unit tests encourages good programming habits, such as writing code that is modular, easy to understand, and testable. This can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
