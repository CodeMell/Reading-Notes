# Readings: Unit Testing and Documentation

## [Unit Testing Best Practices](https://stackify.com/unit-testing-basics-best-practices/)

## ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity:

- Catching Bugs Early: By writing unit tests, developers can identify bugs and errors in their code much earlier in the development cycle, before they propagate to other parts of the application. This can save time and money in the long run by reducing the cost of fixing bugs later in the development cycle.

- Improving Code Quality: Unit testing can help improve code quality by ensuring that each unit of code is functioning correctly and as expected. This helps to prevent errors and unexpected behavior in the application.

- Frequent Releases: By testing code in isolation, developers can quickly identify and fix issues, allowing for faster iteration and more frequent releases.

- Encouraging Good Programming Habits: Writing unit tests encourages good programming habits, such as writing code that is modular, easy to understand, and testable. This can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.

## reasons a quality README is just as important as quality code:

- Documentation and clarity: A README provides clear and concise documentation about the project. It helps other developers, collaborators, or even future you to understand the purpose, functionality, and usage of the codebase. It outlines the project's structure, dependencies, and any specific instructions for setup, configuration, or deployment. Clear documentation saves time and reduces confusion when working with or maintaining the code.

- Onboarding and collaboration: When new developers join a project, a well-written README acts as an onboarding guide. It introduces them to the project's goals, architecture, and conventions. It can include information about coding style, best practices, and guidelines for contributing. This facilitates collaboration and helps maintain consistency across the codebase.

- Accessibility and inclusivity: A README that includes information about accessibility considerations makes the codebase more inclusive. It highlights any special requirements or instructions for users with disabilities, ensuring that everyone can use and contribute to the project. Inclusivity promotes diversity and fosters a welcoming environment for all.

- Open source contributions: If you have an open source project, a quality README is essential for encouraging contributions from the community. It helps potential contributors understand the project's purpose, how to set it up locally, how to contribute code or documentation, and any guidelines for submitting pull requests. A clear and inviting README can attract more contributors and increase the project's adoption.

- Troubleshooting and issue resolution: A good README provides troubleshooting tips, known issues, and frequently asked questions (FAQs). This saves time for users or developers who encounter problems and need quick solutions. By addressing common issues, a README can minimize the number of support requests or bug reports and improve the user experience.

- Maintenance and long-term sustainability: Projects often evolve, and maintaining them over time requires effort. A README that includes information on project structure, architecture, and design decisions can help future maintainers understand the codebase's intended organization and logic. It can also explain the rationale behind certain choices, making it easier to update, refactor, or debug the codebase in the future.
