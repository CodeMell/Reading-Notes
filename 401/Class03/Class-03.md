# File Manipulation / System.IO

[File and Stream I/O](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/index)
- System.IO namespaces contain types that enable reading and writing, both synchronously and asynchronously, on data streams and files.
- Streams provides a generic view of a sequence of bytes. This is an abstract class.
- Streams fundamental operations:

   - Reading - transferring data from a stream into a data structure, such as an array of bytes.

   - Writing - transferring data to a stream from a data source.

   - Seeking - querying and modifying the current position within a stream.
- Compression refers to the process of reducing the size of a file for storage and decompression is the process of extracting the contents of a compressed file so they are in a usable format.
