[CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow) [CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)
1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
    - The way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
    - Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block". 
    -  Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
    - static

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
    - we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page
    -  specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
    - Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.
