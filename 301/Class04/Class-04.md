# React and Forms
(React Docs - Forms)[https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html]
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
    - a ‘Controlled Component’ is an input form element whose value is controlled by React

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
    - We should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because with a controlled component the input’s value is always driven by the React state

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
    - we target what the user is entering by using the value attribute

(The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained)[https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff]
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
    - we use a ternary operator to have less lines to code

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

            if(x===y){
            console.log(true);
            } else {
            console.log(false);
            }

    - condition ? value if true : value if false;
    x===y ? console.log(true):console.log(false);
